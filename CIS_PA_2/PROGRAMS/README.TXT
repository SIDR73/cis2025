README.TXT
The main source file of this code is CIS_PA_2.py. This program contains all the code to take the input data given in the DATA folder and produce the necessary output.

To run CIS_PA_2.py you can run the program and it will prompt you to set a path that navigates to the data directory. An example path would be 
C:\Users\aarus\Documents\CIS_PA_2\PROGRAMS\DATA\\ which is very to similar to what the user would implement, simply changing everything from Users to CIS_PA_2 to reflect where the program is stored in their computer. After inputting this path the program will run and generate all the output files in the folder it is stored in. 

There are also error_check.py and unit_tests.py files present in the folder. These are not source files and were simply used for testing purposes.
error_check.py - Checked our output debug results against given and computed errors

unit_tests.py - Contains unit tests and other validation methods we used.
